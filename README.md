Reproduce Results of Gerard and Hoff (2015)
===========================================

This folder contains the code necessary to reproduce the results of Gerard and Hoff (2015). To reproduce these results you will need to:

1.  Download the appropriate R packages.
2.  Run `make`.
3.  Get some coffee.

Download the appropriate R packages.
====================================

You can obtain all of the needed R packages by running the following code in R:

``` r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "xtable", 
                   "devtools", "snow", "cate", "ggthemes",
                   "stringr"))
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("sva")
devtools::install_github("dcgerard/tensr")
devtools::install_github("dcgerard/hose")
```

To download the code in this repo, click on [this link](https://github.com/dcgerard/hose_paper/archive/master.zip).

Run `make`
==========

To reproduce all of the results of Gerard and Hoff (2015), simply run `make` from the terminal (not in the R session). To reproduce the figure from Section 2, run in the terminal:

``` shell
make change_sv
```

To reproduce the simulation results from the paper, run in the terminal:

``` shell
make sims
```

To reproduce the analysis of NBA statistics, run in the terminal:

``` shell
make nba
```

Get coffee
==========

Some of the simulations will take awhile to run (2 to 10 hours depending on how many cores you are using). You should get some coffee! Here is a list of some of my favorite places:

-   Chicago
    -   [Sawada Coffee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sawada-coffee-chicago)
    -   [Plein Air Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/plein-air-cafe-and-eatery-chicago-2)
-   Seattle
    -   [Bauhaus Ballard](https://www.yelp.com/biz/bauhaus-ballard-seattle)
    -   [Cafe Solstice](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-solstice-seattle)
-   Columbus
    -   [Yeah, Me Too](https://www.yelp.com/biz/yeah-me-too-columbus)
    -   [Stauf's Coffee Roasters](https://www.yelp.com/biz/staufs-coffee-roasters-columbus-2)
    -   [Caffe Apropos](https://www.yelp.com/biz/caff%C3%A9-apropos-columbus-2)

Bugs
====

If you have trouble running this code, then it might be that you need to update your R packages. I ran these simulations under these settings:

As you can see above, I've only tried this on Linux.

If you still have difficulty, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/dcgerard/hose_paper/issues).
